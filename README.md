# XprtCalc
XprtCalc (pronounced expert calc) is an string based calculator for advanced experssions. It supports: vectors, lambda functions, arbitrary-precision, and every common math function. The main functionality is the parsing from an expression to a tree object, and computation of said tree object. This data structure allows for advanced functionality like derivatives.

XprtCalc is currently in development and should not be used for utility yet. The predecessor to this project is [CalcForJS](https://benjamin-cates.github.io/CalcForJS), so it should be used for now.
